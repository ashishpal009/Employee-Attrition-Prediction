# Employee-Attrition-Prediction
This repository contains a comprehensive analysis and predictive modeling project aimed at understanding and predicting employee attrition. The goal is to use various machine learning techniques to predict whether an employee is likely to leave the company

Employee attrition is a critical issue for many organizations, as high turnover rates can lead to significant costs and disruptions. This project explores a dataset related to employee demographics, job satisfaction, work environment, and other factors to build predictive models that can help HR departments identify employees at risk of leaving.

Key Features
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): A thorough analysis of the dataset, including visualizations and statistical summaries, to understand key trends and relationships between features and employee attrition.

Data Preprocessing: Handling missing values, encoding categorical variables, feature scaling, and other preprocessing steps to prepare the data for modeling.

Model Building: Implementation of multiple machine learning models including Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, Random Forest, and XGBoost to predict employee attrition.

Model Evaluation: Comparison of model performance using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and ROC-AUC. Cross-validation and hyperparameter tuning are also performed to optimize model performance.
